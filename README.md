# MOEA for CNN architecture tuning

__We aim to automatically tune optical CNN architectures for different tasks using Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm. An optical CNN architecture should either have higher accuracy or have smaller number of parameters to save memory and computation.__

## Evolutionary Algorithms, EAs
Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) are a non-deterministic algorithm to solve optimization problems for optimal solutions.

## Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithms, MOEAs
If an optimization problem is designed to have multiple evaluation functions
